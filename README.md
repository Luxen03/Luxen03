### Git commands (for school purposes)
- git push, pushes commit history into the repository, most commonly used
	* $ git push --all
- git branch, branches history into different versions, for it not to be affected by the main branch
	* $ git branch -m "name of new branch here"
- git clone, clones the repository into your local device
	* $ git clone =URL here=
- git commit, adds commit into commit history, also most commonly used along with push
	* $ git commit -m "commit title here"
- git fetch, synchronizes local folder with repository, important for synchronizing commits with team members
	* $ git fetch --all

## Collaboration Cheat sheet 😈 (Pau Buan)

1. **Command: `git warp`**

   - **Use Case:** When you want to undo the last commit but keep the changes for further modification before committing again.
   - **Parameters:** None
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     git warp
     ```
     This will undo the last commit and leave your changes staged.

2. **Command: `git explore`**

   - **Use Case:** When you want to visualize the commit history graph in your default web browser.
   - **Parameters:** None
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     git explore
     ```
     Opens a web page displaying a visual representation of your Git history.
